An [Interactive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) interpreter (Z-machine) in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I'm referencing the [Z-Machine Standards Document v1.1](http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/) for the information on how the Z-machine works.

The goal is to eventually hook this up to [Slack](https://slack.com/) for some fun. That means leaving out support for games that require fancy graphics, timing, or sounds. So this will probably be restricted to the earlier Z-machine games only, like [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).
